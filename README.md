You should be able to crack a decent amount of hard LCs, that being said, Google focuses pretty heavily on breadth.
So be sure to practice extensively on:

backtracking(appears very often)
dynamic programming
graphs (dfs, bfs, union find [usually asked as a follow up question to optimize a purely dfs/bfs approach], dijkstra)
two pointers (very often)
binary search (very very often)
I've noticed somewhat of a new trend at Google, namely binary search on monotonic functions, i.e. : https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-largest-sum/.
Several others have mentioned getting interviews on this kind of problem, and you're pretty much gonna be able to come up with a solution instantly if you map it to binary search on sight.
